#Task 1

Create three programs, two of which are clients to a single server. Client1 will send a character to the server process. The server will decrement the letter to the next letter in the alphabet and send the result to client2. Client2 prints the letter it receives and then all the processes terminate. Compile and run this exercise in both the UNIX/LINUX and the Internet domains.

Video and the source code will be available in the below mentioned git Repo.


#Instructions to run

1.Compile using the following commands on linux:  

`gcc server.c -o server`  
`gcc client1.c -o client1`  
`gcc client2.c -o client2`
